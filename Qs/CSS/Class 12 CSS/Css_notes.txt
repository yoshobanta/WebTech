CSS - Cascading Style Sheet . 
Using Css we can add styling to Html document which will make it more presentable.
*It is not a language rather  it is an add on feature for html.
There are three ways in which we can add css to our html document and they are :
1. Inline Css
2. Internal Css
3. External Css

1. Inline Css -  It is a way in which we can provide css in our html document.
We will use this css to apply the css properties directly or individually to any html element by using style attribute.

2. Internal Css - It is the second way of inserting css in our html document.
We will use this way whenever we want to provide our same css styling to multiple html elements within a single web page.
*This method of inserting css is recommended because it will provide uniqueness to every web page.
We will apply this internal css by using style tag. which we will write inside the head tag.

3. External Css - It is the 3rd way of inserting css in our html document.
We will use this way of applying css whenever we do not want to make our Html congested.
*This way is also recommended because error dictation is faster.
